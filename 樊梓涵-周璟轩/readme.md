# Work File

Our group has conducted two works: one for a short blender animetion, another one for a long Adobe Premier video.

Among them, the blender animetion is produced by Fan Zihan, and the premier video is made by Zhou Jingxuan.

In order to obey the rule of Github that we can not upload a file more than 25Mb a time, we use split compression to deal with our long video.
